## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- In order to determine the correct inner track width on the dynamic slider respective to the device screen width, I had to extract the real-time width of the element in JS and factor it into the calculation. I would like to revisit the slider component and modify the JS so that the slider inner-track maintains a precise 4px width ahead of the slider button.
