## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Whilst programming the JavaScript I found a solution using a depreciated method, 'addListener', and had to seek another solution using the 'addEventListener' method instead using the 'Change' argument to handle the change in media query states. 
- Setting IMG's to 'block' in order to remove the border element that comes with 'inline-block' as default; affected page width.
