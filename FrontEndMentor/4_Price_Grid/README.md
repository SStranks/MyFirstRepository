## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- You can set the border-radius on the parent element and have it mask the child elements beneath by setting 'overflow' to 'hidden'.

- In order to align the contents on screen vertically, using flexbox and a container, you need to set the 'body' to height: 100% and then the '.container' to min-height: 100%. Using vh units or max-content will lead to overflow or empty space beyond the contents total height respectively.
