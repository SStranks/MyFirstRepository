## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Z-Index issue with drop-down menus; Ensure the Z-Index is set on the outermost parent element rather than just the specific element (drop-down menu), so that it will all sit above any outer sibling elements.
