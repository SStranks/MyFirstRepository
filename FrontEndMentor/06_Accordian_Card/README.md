## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this challenge I figrued out how to implement the solution using only CSS (no JS). This was accomplished by using the :target psuedo-class and targeting the entire 'li', then using the :target to alter properties on different classes on different elements (bold text, arrow flip, display).

I also learnt how to clip one image whilst leaving another unaffected by the overflow property, by utilizing a nested approach that I found at: [Solution](http://jsfiddle.net/kv0bLpw8/). Unfortunately I was not able to fully complete the positioning of the images at the mobile screen size.. for some reason I could not get the behaviour correct despite repeated experimentation. Perhaps I implemented the general structuring of the images and their respective styling incorrectly, and a better method could have been used.
