// In Bali, as far as I can gather, when ex-pats speak to locals, they basically insert the word 'Pak' as often as possible. I am assured it means something like 'mate' or 'sir' but that could be completely wrong.

// Anyway, as some basic language education(??) this kata requires you to turn any sentence provided (s) into ex-pat balinese waffle by inserting the word 'pak' between every other word. Simple 8kyu :D

// Pak should not be the first or last word. Strings of just spaces should return an empty string.

// My Solution
function pak(s) {
  return s.trim().split(' ').join(' pak ');
}
