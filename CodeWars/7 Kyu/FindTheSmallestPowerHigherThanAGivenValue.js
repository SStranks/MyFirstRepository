// We have the number 12385. We want to know the value of the closest cube but higher than 12385. The answer will be 13824.

// Now, another case. We have the number 1245678. We want to know the 5th power, closest and higher than that number. The value will be 1419857.

// We need a function find_next_power ( findNextPower in JavaScript, CoffeeScript and Haskell), that receives two arguments, a value val, and the exponent of the power, pow_, and outputs the value that we want to find.

// Let'see some cases:

// findNextPower(12385, 3) == 13824

// findNextPower(1245678, 5) == 1419857
// The value, val will be always a positive integer.

// The power, pow_, always higher than 1.

// My Solution
function findNextPower(val, pow_) {
  let i = 1;
  while (Math.pow(i, pow_) <= val) {
    i++;
  }
  return Math.pow(i, pow_);
}
