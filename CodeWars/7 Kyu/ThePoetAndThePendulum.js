// Scenario
// the rhythm of beautiful musical notes is drawing a Pendulum

// Beautiful musical notes are the Numbers!alt!alt
// Task
// Given an array/list [] of n integers , Arrange them in a way similar to the to-and-fro movement of a Pendulum

// The Smallest element of the list of integers , must come in center position of array/list.

// The Higher than smallest , goes to the right .
// The Next higher number goes to the left of minimum number and So on , in a to-and-fro manner similar to that of a Pendulum.

// !alt
// Notes
// Array/list size is at least 3 .

// In Even array size , The minimum element should be moved to (n-1)/2 index (considering that indexes start from 0)

// Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are included when Arranging).

// Input >> Output Examples:
// pendulum ([6, 6, 8 ,5 ,10]) ==> [10, 6, 5, 6, 8]
// Explanation:
// Since , 5 is the The Smallest element of the list of integers , came in The center position of array/list

// The Higher than smallest is 6 goes to the right of 5 .

// The Next higher number goes to the left of minimum number and So on .

// Remember , Duplications are included when Arranging , Don't Delete Them .

// pendulum ([-9, -2, -10, -6]) ==> [-6, -10, -9, -2]
// Explanation:
// Since , -10 is the The Smallest element of the list of integers , came in The center position of array/list

// The Higher than smallest is -9 goes to the right of it .

// The Next higher number goes to the left of -10 , and So on .

// Remeber , In Even array size , The minimum element moved to (n-1)/2 index (considering that indexes start from 0) .

// pendulum ([11, -16, -18, 13, -11, -12, 3, 18 ]) ==> [13, 3, -12, -18, -16, -11, 11, 18]
// Explanation:
// Since , -18 is the The Smallest element of the list of integers , came in The center position of array/list

// The Higher than smallest is -16 goes to the right of it .

// The Next higher number goes to the left of -18 , and So on .

// Remember , In Even array size , The minimum element moved to (n-1)/2 index (considering that indexes start from 0) .

// Tune Your Code , There are 200 Assertions , 60.000 element For Each .

// My Solution
function pendulum(values) {
  const even = [],
    odd = [];
  const sortArr = values.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);
  sortArr.forEach((el, i) => (!(i % 2) ? even.push(el) : odd.push(el)));
  return even.reverse().concat(odd);
}

// Other Solutions
const pendulum = (values) =>
  values
    .sort((a, b) => a - b)
    .reduce((pre, val) => (pre.length % 2 ? [...pre, val] : [val, ...pre]), []);
