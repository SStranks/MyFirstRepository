// It happened decades before Snapchat, years before Twitter and even before Facebook. Targeted advertising was a bit of a challenge back then. One day, the marketing professor at my university told us a story that I am yet to confirm using reliable sources. Nevertheless, I retold the story to dozens of my students already, so, sorry BMW if it is all a big lie.

// Allegedly, BMW, in an attempt to target the educated, produced billboard posters featuring the English alphabet with three letters missing: B, M and W. Needless to say, many were confused, some to the extent of road accidents.

// Your task is to write a function that takes one parameter str that MUST be a string and removes all capital and small letters B, M and W.
// If data of the wrong data type was sent as a parameter the function must throw an error with the following specific message:

// new Error("This program only works for text.");

// My Solution
function removeBMW(str) {
  if (typeof str !== 'string') throw new Error('This program only works for text.');
  return str.replace(/[bmw]/gi, '');
}
