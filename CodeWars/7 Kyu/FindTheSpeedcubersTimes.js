// Speedcubing is the hobby involving solving a variety of twisty puzzles, the most famous being the 3x3x3 puzzle or Rubik's Cube, as quickly as possible.

// In the majority of Speedcubing competitions, a Cuber solves a scrambled cube 5 times, and their result is found by taking the average of the middle 3 solves (ie. the slowest and fastest times are disregarded, and an average is taken of the remaining times).

// In some competitions, the unlikely event of a tie situation is resolved by comparing Cuber's fastest times.

// Write a function cube_times(times) that, given an array of floats times returns an array / tuple with the Cuber's result (to 2 decimal places) AND their fastest solve.

// For example:

// cubeTimes([9.5, 7.6, 11.4, 10.5, 8.1]) = [9.37, 7.6]
// // Because (9.5 + 10.5 + 8.1) / 3 = 9.37 and 7.6 was the fastest solve.
// Note: times will always be a valid array of 5 positive floats (representing seconds)


// My Solution
function cubeTimes(times) {
  return [Number((times.sort((a, b) => a - b).slice(1, 4).reduce((cur, acc) => cur + acc, 0) / 3).toFixed(2)), Math.min(...times)]
}
