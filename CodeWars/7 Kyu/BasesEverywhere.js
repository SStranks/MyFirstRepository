// Uh oh, Someone at the office has dropped all these sequences on the floor and forgotten to label them with their correct bases.

// We have to fix this before the boss gets back or we're all going to be fired!

// This is what your years of coding have been leading up to, now is your time to shine!

// Task
// You will have to create a function which takes in a sequence of numbers in random order and you will have to return the correct base of those numbers.

// The base is the number of unique digits. For example, a base 10 number can have 10 unique digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a base 2 number (Binary) can have 2 unique digits: 0 and 1.

// Constraints
// The sequence will always be 10 numbers long and we know that the base is going to be between 2 and 10 inclusive so no need to worry about any letters. When sorted, the sequence is made up of consecutive numbers.

// Examples
// [ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10" ]     -->  10
// [ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "10", "11", "12", "13" ]  -->   7


// My Solution
function baseFinder(seq){
  seq.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  let i = 0;
  for (i; i < seq.length - 1; i++) {
    if (Number((seq[i])[seq[i].length - 1]) !== Number((seq[i + 1])[seq[i + 1].length - 1] - 1)) break;
  }
  return Number((seq[i])[seq[i].length - 1]) + 1
}

// Other Soltuions
function baseFinder(seq){
  return new Set(seq.join``).size
}
