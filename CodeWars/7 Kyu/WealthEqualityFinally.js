// The year is 2088 and the Radical Marxist Socialist People's Party (RMSPP) has just seized power in Brazil.

// Their first act in power is absolute wealth equality through coercive redistribution.

// Create a function that redistributes all wealth equally among all citizens.

// Wealth is represented as an array/list where every index is the wealth of a single citizen.
// The function should mutate the input such that every index has the same amount of wealth.
// MUTATE the input array/list, don't return anything.

// See example:

// wealth = [5, 10, 6]  # This represents:
//                      # citizen 1 has wealth 5
//                      # citizen 2 has wealth 10
//                      # citizen 3 has wealth 6

// redistribute_wealth(wealth) # mutates wealth list
// wealth => [7, 7, 7] # wealth has now been equally redistributed
// Info:

// MUTATE the input array/list, don't return anything
// Input is garantueed to hold at least 1 citizen
// Wealth of citizen will an integer with minimum 0 (negative wealth not possible)
// Handling of floating point error will not be tested

// My Solution
function redistributeWealth(wealth) {
  const v = wealth.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0) / wealth.length;
  wealth.forEach((_, i) => (wealth[i] = v));
}
