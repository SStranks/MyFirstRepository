For this kata you will have to forget how to add two numbers.

It can be best explained using the following meme:

In simple terms, our method does not like the principle of carrying over numbers and just writes down every number it calculates :-)

You may assume both integers are positive integers.

Examples
16+1821426+39515122+811103\large \begin{array}{lll} & 1 & 6 \\ + & 1 & 8 \\ \hline & 2 & 1 4 \\ \end{array} \qquad \large \begin{array}{lll} & 2 & 6 \\ + & 3 & 9 \\ \hline & 5 & 15 \\ \end{array} \qquad \large \begin{array}{lll} & 1 & 2 & 2 \\ + & & 8 & 1 \\ \hline & 1 & 10 & 3 \\ \end{array}
