// Introduction
// The Robber Language (Rövarspråket) is a Swedish cant used by children to mislead people not familiar with the language. It's used by kids in several screenplays created by Astrid Lindgren.

// The idea is that every consonant in a sentence is duplicated, with an o inserted in between (b becomes bob). Vowels are left untouched (a remains an a). It's quite hard for an untrained ear to understand a conversation encoded in this manner, especially if spoken rapidly.

// Example
// In this example, the consonants f, b and r are modified. The vowels o and a are left untouched.

// 'foo bar' => 'fofoo bobaror' (`fof-o-o bob-a-ror`)
// Note: The dashes - in the example are added for readability and should not be included in the output.

// The Assignment
// Your task is to implement a function function robberEncode(sentence) which takes in a string sentence and returns the result, converted into robber language, as a string.

// Notes
// Only consonants should be modified; leave all other characters unchanged.
// Both upper and lower case characters will be tested.
// The case of the o character and the neighboring consonants should match (F => FOF and f => fof).
// For the purpose of this kata, a character is considered a consonant if it's equal to one of the letters BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ.
// Testing
// The tests will challenge your function with sentences of length 0-255, ASCII characters between 32-126 and nothing else.

// My Solution
function robberEncode(sentence) {
  return sentence.replace(/[BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ]/gi, (el) =>
    el === el.toLowerCase() ? `${el}o${el}` : `${el}O${el}`
  );
}
