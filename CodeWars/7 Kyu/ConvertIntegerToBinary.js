// Convert integers to binary as simple as that. You would be given an integer as a argument and you have to return its binary form. To get an idea about how to convert a decimal number into a binary number, visit here.

// Notes: negative numbers should be handled as two's complement; assume all numbers are integers stored using 4 bytes (or 32 bits) in any language.

// Your output should ignore leading 0s.

// So, for example:

// toBinary(3)=="11"
// toBinary(-3)=="11111111111111111111111111111101

// My Solution
function toBinary(n) {
  return (n >>> 0).toString(2);
}
