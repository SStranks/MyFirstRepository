// As you may know, once some people pass their teens, they jokingly only celebrate their 20th or 21st birthday, forever. With some maths skills, that's totally possible - you only need to select the correct number base!

// For example, if they turn 32, that's exactly 20 - in base 16... Already 39? That's just 21, in base 19!

// Your task is to translate the given age to the much desired 20 (or 21) years, and indicate the number base, in the format specified below.

// Note: input will be always > 21

// Examples:
// 32  -->  "32? That's just 20, in base 16!"
// 39  -->  "39? That's just 21, in base 19!"
// Hint: if you don't know (enough) about numeral systems and radix, just observe the pattern!

// My Solution
function womensAge(n) {
  return `${n}? That's just ${n % 2 === 0 ? 20 : 21}, in base ${
    n % 2 === 0 ? n / 2 : (n - 1) / 2
  }!`;
}

// Other Solutions
function womensAge(n) {
  return `${n}? That's just ${20 + (n % 2)}, in base ${Math.floor(n / 2)}!`;
}
