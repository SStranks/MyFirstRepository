// Who is the killer?
// Some people have been killed!
// You have managed to narrow the suspects down to just a few. Luckily, you know every person who those suspects have seen on the day of the murders.

// Task.
// Given a dictionary with all the names of the suspects and everyone that they have seen on that day which may look like this:

// {'James': ['Jacob', 'Bill', 'Lucas'],
//  'Johnny': ['David', 'Kyle', 'Lucas'],
//  'Peter': ['Lucy', 'Kyle']}
// and also a list of the names of the dead people:

// ['Lucas', 'Bill']
// return the name of the one killer, in our case 'James' because he is the only person that saw both 'Lucas' and 'Bill'

// My Solution
function killer(suspectInfo, dead) {
  return Object.entries(suspectInfo).find((el) => dead.every((p) => el[1].includes(p)))[0];
}

// Other Solutions
function killer(suspectInfo, dead) {
  return Object.keys(suspectInfo).find((x) => dead.every((y) => suspectInfo[x].includes(y)));
}
