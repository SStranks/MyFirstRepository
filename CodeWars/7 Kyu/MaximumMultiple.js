// Task
// Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,

// Conditions :
// N is divisible by divisor

// N is less than or equal to bound

// N is greater than 0.

// Notes
// The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positive values .
// It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found .

// My Solution
function maxMultiple(divisor, bound) {
  return Math.floor(bound / divisor) * divisor;
}
