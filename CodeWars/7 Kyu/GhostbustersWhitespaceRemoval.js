// Oh no! Ghosts have reportedly swarmed the city. It's your job to get rid of them and save the day!

// In this kata, strings represent buildings while whitespaces within those strings represent ghosts.

// So what are you waiting for? Return the building(string) without any ghosts(whitespaces)!

// Example:

// ghostBusters("Sky scra per");
// Should return:

// "Skyscraper"
// If the building contains no ghosts, return the string:

// "You just wanted my autograph didn't you?"

// My Solution
function ghostBusters(building) {
  return /\s/.test(building)
    ? building.replace(/\s/g, '')
    : `You just wanted my autograph didn't you?`;
}
