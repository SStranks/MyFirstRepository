// There are some stones on Bob's table in a row, and each of them can be red, green or blue, indicated by the characters R, G, and B.

// Help Bob find the minimum number of stones he needs to remove from the table so that the stones in each pair of adjacent stones have different colours.

// Examples:

// "RGBRGBRGGB"   => 1
// "RGGRGBBRGRR"  => 3
// "RRRRGGGGBBBB" => 9

// My Solution
function solve(stones) {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < stones.length - 1; i++) {
    if (stones[i] !== stones[i + 1]) continue;
    count++;
  }
  return count;
}
