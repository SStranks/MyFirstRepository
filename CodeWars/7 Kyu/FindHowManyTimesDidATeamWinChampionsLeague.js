// Create a function that takes two arguments:

// An array of objects which feature the season, the team and the country of the Champions League winner.

// Country (as a string, for example, 'Portugal')

// You function should then return the number which represents the number of times a team from a given country has won. Return 0 if there have been no wins.

// For example if the input array is as follows:

// countWins(winnerList1, 'Spain') => should return 2
// countWins(winnerList1, 'Portugal') => should return 1
// countWins(winnerList1, 'Sportland') => should return 0

// My Solution
function countWins(winnerList, country) {
  return winnerList.filter((el) => el.country === country).length;
}
