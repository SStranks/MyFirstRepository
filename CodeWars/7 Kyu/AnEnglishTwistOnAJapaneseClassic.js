// Background:
// In Japan, a game called Shiritori is played. The rules are simple, a group of people take turns calling out a word whose beginning syllable is the same as the previous player's ending syllable. For example, the first person would say the word ねこ, and the second player must make a word that starts with こ, like　こむぎ. This repeats until a player can not think of a word fast enough or makes a word that ends in ん, because there are no words that begin with ん　in the Japanese language.

// English Shiritori has the same principle, with the first and last letters of words. That being said the lose condition is saying a word that doesn't start with the previous word's last letter or not saying a word quick enough.

// For example: apple -> eggs -> salmon -> nut -> turkey ...

// Your Task:
// You will be given a list of strings, a transcript of an English Shiritori match. Your task is to find out if the game ended early, and return a list that contains every valid string until the mistake. If a list is empty return an empty list. If one of the elements is an empty string, that is invalid and should be handled.

// Examples:
// All elements valid:
// The array {"dog","goose","elephant","tiger","rhino","orc","cat"}

// should return {"dog","goose","elephant","tiger","rhino","orc","cat"}

// An invalid element at index 2:
// The array {"dog","goose","tiger","cat", "elephant","rhino","orc"}

// should return ("dog","goose") since goose ends in 'e' and tiger starts with 't'

// An invalid empty string at index 2:
// The array {"ab","bc","","cd"}

// should return ("ab","bc")

// All invalid empty string at index 0:
// The array {"","bc","","cd"}

// should return An Empty List

// Notes:
// 猫 = ねこ = neko = cat

// 小麦 = こむぎ = komugi = wheat

// My Solution
function shiritori(words) {
  const retArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    if (words[i] === '') break;
    if (i === 0) {
      retArr.push(words[i]);
      continue;
    }
    if (words[i][0] !== words[i - 1][words[i - 1].length - 1]) break;
    retArr.push(words[i]);
  }
  return retArr;
}

// Other Solutions
function shiritori(words) {
  let res = [];
  for (let w of words) {
    if (!w.length || (res.length && w[0] !== res[res.length - 1].slice(-1))) break;
    res.push(w);
  }
  return res;
}
