// Given a random string consisting of numbers, letters, symbols, you need to sum up the numbers in the string.

// Note:

// Consecutive integers should be treated as a single number. eg, 2015 should be treated as a single number 2015, NOT four numbers
// All the numbers should be treaded as positive integer. eg, 11-14 should be treated as two numbers 11 and 14. Same as 3.14, should be treated as two numbers 3 and 14
// If no number was given in the string, it should return 0
// Example:

// str = "In 2015, I want to know how much does iPhone 6+ cost?"
// The numbers are 2015, 6

// Sum is 2021.

// My Solution
function sumFromString(str) {
  const matches = str.match(/[0-9]+/g) || [0];
  return matches.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + Number(cur), 0);
}

// Other Solutions
function sumFromString(str) {
  return (str.match(/\d+/g) || []).map(Number).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
