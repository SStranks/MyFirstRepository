// Imagine you are creating a game where the user has to guess the correct number. But there is a limit of how many guesses the user can do.

// If the user tries to guess more than the limit, the function should throw an error.
// If the user guess is right it should return true.
// If the user guess is wrong it should return false and lose a life.
// Can you finish the game so all the rules are met?


// My Solution
class Guesser {
  constructor(number, lives) {
    this.number = number;
    this.lives = lives;
  }
  
  guess(n) {
    if (this.lives === 0) throw new Error("already dead");
    if (n === this.number) return true;
    this.lives -= 1;
    return false;
  }
