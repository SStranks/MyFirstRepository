// This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.

// Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, you have NO CONTROL over its value.

// Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

// Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.


// My Solution
function preFizz(n) {
  return Array.from({length: n}, (_, i) => i + 1);
}
