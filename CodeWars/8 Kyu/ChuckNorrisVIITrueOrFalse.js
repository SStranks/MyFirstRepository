// It's a well known fact that anything Chuck Norris wants, he gets. As a result Chuck very rarely has to use the word false.

// It is a less well known fact that if something is true, and Chuck doesn't want it to be, Chuck can scare the truth with his massive biceps, and it automatically becomes false.

// Your task is to be more like Chuck (ha! good luck!). You must return false without ever actually using the word false...

// Go show some truth who's boss!


// My Solution
