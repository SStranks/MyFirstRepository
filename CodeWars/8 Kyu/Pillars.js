// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

// number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
// distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
// width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

// mY Solution
function pillars(num_pill, dist, width) {
  if (num_pill === 1) return 0;
  return (dist * (num_pill - 1) * 100) + (num_pill * width) - (2 * width);
}
