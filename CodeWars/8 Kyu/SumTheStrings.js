// Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):
// If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.
// Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (2^31 - 1)

// My Solution
function sumStr(a,b) {
  return (a*1 + b*1) + '';
}
