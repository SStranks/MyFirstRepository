// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).


// My Solution
const rooms = {
  bedroom : {name: "bedroom", description: "for sleeping", completed: true},
  lounge : {name: "lounge", description: "for recreation", completed: false},
  study : {name: "study", description: "for studying", completed: false}
 }
